{"name":"code2html","body":"[code2html](http://ssinica.github.com/code2html/)\r\n=========== \r\n\r\nCode2Html is library which converts code to HTML.\r\n\r\nWhen you may need it?\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nAssume you have code which you want to share on your blog. Code2Html helps to resolve this task in very simple yet beautiful manner. Copy your code to clipboard (Ctrl + C), press predefined key combination, and paste (Ctrl + V) HTML snippet to your blog. That is it!\r\n\r\nSupported code types\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nFor now following code types are supported:\r\n\r\n* CSS\r\n* HTML\r\n\r\nQuick Start\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* Download latest version from https://github.com/ssinica/code2html/downloads.\r\n* Unzip and run code2html.exe\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n* JRE 6.0\r\n* Windows 64bit\r\n\r\nUnder the hood\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nCode2Html is written in Java. In [code2html.zip](https://github.com/ssinica/code2html/downloads) you will find engine jar and client application. Client application uses [JIntellitype](http://melloware.com/products/jintellitype/index.html) to register global hotkeys, so for now it can be used only from Windows (but it can be easy rewritten to use alternative libraries for other OS).\r\n\r\nClient application resides in system tray and listens for predefined key press. Distinct hot key are defined for each code type:\r\n* `Ctrl + Shift + 1`  for  CSS\r\n* `Ctrl + Shift + 2`  for  HTML\r\n               \r\nYou can assign different formatting themes for each code type in file `/props/code2html.properties`. Two themes are available for the moment:\r\n\r\n* default\r\n* dark\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Utility to generate HTML from code for pasting to blogs","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
